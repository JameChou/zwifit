I need to write more about this, and how it's structured, but for now... this is a collection point for my thoughts
on what it can and should be.

I need to expose:

1. Status (IFit connection).
2. Routes (recording and playback).
3. Settings like IFit IP address and units.

Status and control could display on the same screen very intuitively.
Routes can be a link off of that screen, maybe in the top left.
Settings too, but in the top right.
